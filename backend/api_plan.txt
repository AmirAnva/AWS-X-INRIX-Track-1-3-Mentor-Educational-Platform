    Sockets:

    - Connect 
    Connect so that chat and scratch pad work with no load time

    - update_scratch (scratchpad id)
    - complete_scratch (scratchpad id: once quiz submitted, then can parse with ai and find knowledge difference)
    REST:
    - get_homepage (the page itself)
    - get_homepage_data (assignments, announcements)


Client Endpoints (Socket Only):
    - chat_message (incoming chat message)
